# Data Visualizations

## Motivation:
I make this data visualizations because I study Data Science. I would 
like to walk through the Python Standard Library + matplotlib and 
plotly. 

## Rights:
This data visualizations are made on the basis of the book "Python 
Crash Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" 
by Eric Matthes. The autor of the book give me the right, I quote, "to 
share the code you wrote for the exercises in the book to show people 
what you have learned", but he give me one stipulation, I quote, "as 
long as you're not trying to create a learning resource based largely 
on the material from this book". So please don't create a learning 
resource from this material.

## Requirements: 
python 3.7 - rest in requirements.txt .

## Remarks:
- I make this script so that the master branch has always the 
  functioning code.
- The mpl_squares.py script is a standalone script. After running this 
  script, the standard plot of the quadratic function is shown, where 
  the five given points on the plot are connected by straight lines.

## Data Visualizations Summary:
I made a simple line graph. I will make a simple scatter plot. Then I 
will make a visualization based on series of random decisions (random 
walk). I also intend to use the plotly package for one visualization, 
where we will check what will happen when we roll the dice in many 
different ways.

## Version:
The version of the code only with the simple line graph has tag 1.0.
