# Data Visualizations

## Motivation:
I make this data visualizations because I study Data Science. I would 
like to walk through the Python Standard Library + matplotlib and 
plotly. 

## Rights:
This data visualizations are made on the basis of the book "Python 
Crash Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" 
by Eric Matthes. The autor of the book give me the right, I quote, "to 
share the code you wrote for the exercises in the book to show people 
what you have learned", but he give me one stipulation, I quote, "as 
long as you're not trying to create a learning resource based largely 
on the material from this book". So please don't create a learning 
resource from this material.

## Requirements: 
python 3.7 - rest in requirements.txt .

## Remarks:
- I make this script so that the master branch has always the 
  functioning code.
- The mpl_squares.py script is a standalone script. After running this 
  script, the standard plot of the quadratic function is shown, where 
  the five given points on the plot are connected by straight lines.
- The scatter_squares.py script is a standalone script. After running 
  this script, the plot of the quadratic function is shown, where the 
  points are generated automatically. This script uses the color maps 
  and saves the resulting plot to the file squares_plot.png.

## Data Visualizations Summary:
I made a simple line plot and the scatter plot. Then I will make a 
visualization based on series of random decisions (random walk). I 
also intend to use the plotly package for one visualization, where we 
will check what will happen when we roll the dice in many 
different ways.

## Version:
- The version of the code only with the simple line plot has tag 1.0.
- The version of the code with the line plot and scatter plot has tag 
  2.0.
