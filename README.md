# Data Visualizations

## Motivation:
I make this data visualizations because I study Data Science. I would 
like to walk through the Python Standard Library + matplotlib and 
plotly. 

## Rights:
This data visualizations are made on the basis of the book "Python 
Crash Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" 
by Eric Matthes. The autor of the book give me the right, I quote, "to 
share the code you wrote for the exercises in the book to show people 
what you have learned", but he give me one stipulation, I quote, "as 
long as you're not trying to create a learning resource based largely 
on the material from this book". So please don't create a learning 
resource from this material.

## Requirements: 
python 3.7 - rest in requirements.txt .

## Remarks:
I make this data visualizations so that the master branch has always 
the functioning code. To run the appropriate data visualization you 
need to run the appropriate file. I will later describe which file 
what runs.

## Data Visualizations Summary:
I will make a simple line graph, a simple scatter plot. Then I will 
make a visualization based on series of random decisions 
(random walk). I also intend to use the plotly package for one 
visualization, where we will check what will happen when we roll 
the dice in many different ways. I'll write more about the summary 
later.

## Version:
I will write about a version for the package of the data 
visualizations later.
